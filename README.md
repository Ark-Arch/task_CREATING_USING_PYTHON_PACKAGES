PROJECT TITLE
Simple Game Of "Rock, Paper, Scissors".

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a simple console application that allows one user to interact with the console and play a game of rock, paper and scissors.
The program was written entirely with the python program while making good use of python functions and function calls.
This project also tried to describe the concept of import libaries and functions.

My initial challenge with this project was to figure out how to write the program for its functions without much repetition of the if,else statement - especially when deciding when a win has occurred.

As an improvement (say for a version 2 of the program) is to develop some sort of GUI application for this game with the same functional requirement. I believe it would be much more interactive and intuitive to select pictures as rock, paper or scissors rather than typing out.

INSTALLATION AND RUNNING THE PROGRAM
To run this program successfully, the user must have at the least, the python 3 downloaded and installed on his machine.
After which all the user have to do is to run "python main.py" on the machine's command prompt after locating the file and its folder.


CREDITS
For this particular program and all I have learnt from writing it, all credit goes to the ZURI PROGRAM in collaboration with the INGRESSIVE 4 GOOD platform.
